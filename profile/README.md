🙋‍♀️ ATTAC (Alerta Temprana por Terremoto en America Central) aims to operate public EEW alerts in Nicaragua, El Salvador, Costa Rica, and Guatemala, and to create long-lasting governance mechanisms within each nation that can support EEW after the project is completed. We do this in 4 main efforts (i) creating National EEW advisory groups that aim to fund, guide and evaluate the EEW systems; (ii) explore and invest in promising technologies that can deliver timely alerts to as much of the population as possible; (iii) continue to support seismic networks and enhance our EEW algorithms in regionally-appropriate manner (noisy seismic station, off-shore seismicity) and (iv) investigate optimal messaging for the populations and conduct public awareness campaigns.
